        "description": "This idea addresses the real problems I have had with having to store hundreds if not thousands of family photos in sequential folders, as well as often coming across distant relatives in photos and not knowing who they are.\nThis app would let family members jointly build their family tree and tag family members when storing photos. Photos can also be associated with time and location. A powerful search functionality would let users easily find photos across those dimensions. It could eventually even have facial-recognition functionality to auto-tag people.\nI have already done quite a bit of work in designing the graph database for this and planning how the back-end would work. But this is a complex idea and I would love to work with a UX/UI designer who can begin to ideate what an accessible and intuitive user interface for this app could look like. ",
