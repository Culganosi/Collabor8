Photos can also be associated with time and location. A powerful search functionality would let users easily find photos across those dimensions. It could eventually even have facial-recognition functionality to auto-tag people.\nI have already done quite a bit of work in designing the graph database for this and planning how the back-end would work. But this is a complex idea and I would love to work with a UX/UI designer who can begin to ideate what an accessible and intuitive user interface for this app could look like. ",
